üëãüèº Hey! My name is Poorva and I am a recent graduate of Stockton University‚Äôs Master's of Data Science & Strategic Analytics Program!

## Overview
üìå This repository showcases my projects, academic coursework, and other relevant experiences in the field of data science.

## Projects
### [Project 1: Monthly Stocks](https://poorvasprojects.shinyapps.io/monthlystocks/)
**Description**: This dashboard allows users to see the amount of returns made by four major companies from 2014-2018.
- **Technologies Used**: R, RStudio, R Shiny

### [Project 2: Power & Proseperity ](https://poorvasprojects.shinyapps.io/Downloads/)
**Description**: This project examined two distinct datasets to investigate the potential correlation between a nation's wealth and its energy consumption. Specifically, the relationship between the economic productivity of countries, measured in terms of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), and their energy usage, quantified as kilograms of oil equivalent per capita, spanning from the 1950s to the 2010s. Shiny Dashboard was created for an interactive visual.
- **Technologies Used**: R, RStudio, R Shiny

### Project 3: Ecometrics
**Description**: A dataset regarding measurements of gas emissions per kg of food product across different stages in the lifecycle of food production was cleaned. A database was created in SQL, including creating and populating tables, where the data was transfered. Queries were performed to answer questions regarding the data.
- **Technologies Used**: R, Visual Studio, MySQL

### [Project 4: Predicting Mortality Rates from Cancer with Machine Learning](https://medium.com/@poorvapatel01/predicting-mortality-rates-from-cancer-with-machine-learning-86e0dd125eda)
**Description**: A machine learning model was created using python from a dataset regarding cancer. The data was prepared by feature selection, data splitting, and feature scaling. API was created and deployed for the model.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, FastAPI, VPS

### Project 5: Seasonal Rhythms: An Exploratory Analysis of Human Behavior
**Description**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) investigated the relationship between the four seasons and crime incidences, seeking to uncover patterns that could offer insights into human behavior.
- **Technologies Used**: R, Excel

### [Project 6: Leveraging AI and Machine Learning to Understand Business Performance Through Yelp Reviews](https://medium.com/@poorvapatel01/leveraging-ai-and-machine-learning-to-understand-business-performance-through-yelp-reviews-a0ec8d16c688)
**Description**: Leadx is a recently established consulting company that aims to further the success of small/medium businesses. This ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Yelp web scraping project would help expand Leadx's capabilities in providing actionable insights to their clients.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, SQL

## Courses Taken
üìö Below are the key courses I have completed that are relevant to data science:

- **Intro to Data Science & Analytics**: Learn about data types, sources, and linux.
- **Data Exploration**: Techniques such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and basic statistical methods using R
- **Data Visualization**: Communicate data insights through visual means. Topics include principles of visual design, and the use of tools such as Tableau, R Shiny, and Matplotlib to create charts, graphs, and dashboards.
- **Data Gathering & Warehousing**: Create and design databases in SQL. Query information.
- **Deep Learning**: Focus on deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Learn about training techniques, optimization algorithms, and applications such as image and speech recognition.
- **Machine Learning Fundamentals**: Learn supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Topics include regression, classification, clustering, random forest and evaluation metrics.
- **Data Entrepreneurship**: Learn data product development, identifying market needs, and leveraging analytics to create value for startups 
- **Data Stewardship**: Focus on ethical considerations, governance, and responsibility in handling data. Including data privacy, security, compliance.
- **Communicating Data Stories**: Importance of storytelling. Making the data actionable and understandable.
- **Data Practicum**: Encompasses Web scraping, APIs, and databases. Includes database design, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and tools for storing large datasets in a structured way.
